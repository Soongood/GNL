## GNL 42 school's project

A C function that reads any valid file line by line until the end.

[get_next_line](get_next_line.en.pdf) is an individual project at [42](https://www.42.us.org/) that basically reads a file line by line.

Disclaimer: There are so many easier methods of doing this by using standard C functions. But the goal here is to be able to do it by using any functions from my [libft](https://github.com/Soongood/libft) and only the standard functions read, malloc and free.

After finishing this project, you'll definitely learn some more about static variables, pointers, arrays, linked lists (if you decide to do the bonus part), dynamic memory allocation and file manipulation.
